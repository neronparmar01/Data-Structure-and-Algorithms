## LaTex Formulas

The formula for calculating the length of the hypothenus (c) given right angle triangle with side lengths a and b in LaTex is, $$c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$$
The formula for the geometric series, for sum from i = 0 to n is, $$∑_{i=0}^{n} ar^i$$
The formula for the arithematic series in closed form is, $$∑_{i=0}^{n}i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

$\textit{1. What aspect of the lab did you find to be the hardest?}$

As this was the first lab of this course, i found it pretty difficult to go with the methods and on the other hand easy too. However, the most hardest part for me of the lab was LaTex. Yet, not the whole latex but the formula part was too hard to get it and get one by one correctly, it took me too much of time. However, it was much fun to learn the new thing, writing formulas in Latext.

$\textit{2. What do you think about CodeSpaces? What did you like/not like about Codespaces?}$

Using codespace was a very good experience for me. It was the first time using of it, so did not got too much idea of what about coding of long lines. However, the most important thing that i liked about codespaces is that the interface is same as the visual studio code and also the using it is quite easy.
